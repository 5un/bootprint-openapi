## Usage

```
bootprint swagger http://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json target
```

The directory "target" should now contain a file `index.html` and `main.css` which contain a readble
form of the [Swagger-Petstore-Example](http://petstore.swagger.io/).

For details about command line parameters, please refer to the
[documentation of the Bootprint](https://github.com/nknapp/bootprint)

`bootprint-swagger` is just a template-module for `bootprint`. That means, it contains
[LessCss-file](less), [Handlebars-partials](handlebars/partials) and a
[preprocessor](lib/preprocessor.js) that converts
[a Swagger-Specification](http://swagger.io) into the JSON actually needed by the templates.

### Create a single file.

If you want to have a single HTML-file, not one HTML and one CSS, you can use substack's [html-inline](https://github.com/substack/html-inline)
package to generate a self-cotnained file:

```
npm -g install html-inline
html-inline target/index.html
```



### Javascript-Usage

The does essentially the same, just in a the above command line, just in JavaScript (i.e. `node`)

{{{example 'examples/example.js'}}}
