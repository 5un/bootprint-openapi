## API

The API of Bootprint-Swagger consists of Handlebars-partials that can be overridden and
LessCss-Definitions, that can be adapted.

### Handlebars partials

About 40 Handlebars partials are used to render this project.
The following documentation is not final yet and there are a lot of partials without real documentation, but you may already have a look
at it: The [partials documentation](handlebars-partials.md) describes the partials in use
and the order in which they are called. You can override these partials in a
[Bootprint configuration file](https://github.com/nknapp/bootprint/blob/master/doc/config.md#overriding-and-adding-partials).
